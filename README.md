# IPL Score Prediction Machine Learning

## Live Demo
ðŸ”´ Check out the live application: [IPL Score Predictor](https://shankersingh01-ipl-score-prediction-machine-learning-app-zewyqk.streamlit.app/)

## Overview
This project is a machine learning application that predicts IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match scores. Using historical IPL data and advanced machine learning algorithms, the model predicts the likely score range for a match based on the batting and bowling teams.

## Features
- Real-time score prediction
- Interactive user interface built with Streamlit
- Support for all IPL teams
- Prediction with confidence intervals
- Easy-to-use team selection interface

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor)

## Local Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shankersingh01/IPL-Score-Prediction-Machine-Learning.git
cd IPL-Score-Prediction-Machine-Learning
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
